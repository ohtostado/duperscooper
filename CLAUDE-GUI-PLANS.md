# CLAUDE GUI PLANS

The GUI must have a settings/preferences/options panel, accessible through the menus in accordance with per-OS best practices (this means it could be in a different menu location on MacOS vs Linux vs Windows)

The GUI should be cross-platform. It should work on Linux, MacOS and Windows.

The GUI should keep track of files that have been deleted in the current session for the user to easily call up and start a restoration.

The GUI should make it easy to recall deletions from previous sessions (maybe keep track of manifests that were created in past sessions)

the user should have the ability to open the log output in a larger scrollable window or an external program. the GUI should also have the facility to save the log output.
